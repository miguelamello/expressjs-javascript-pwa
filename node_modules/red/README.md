# RED (React Experience Design)

> NOTE: This project is heavy work in progress. Do not consume unless you
> know what you're doing.

This project is an attempt in redefining how we define and consume React
components in our projects.

## Installation

```
npm install --save red
```

We consume the latest React and ReactDOM as `peerDependencies`, make sure that
these are also installed in your project:

```
npm install --save react@18 react-dom@18
```
