## CURRENCY CONVERSION MICROSERVICE

This microservice allows an easily conversion between country currencies. Currency rates are updated frequently and applied to the conservion calculation. All the information relevant to 
this microservice is provided in this documentation. 

## objective

The main objective of this microservice is to offer a fast and effective way of converting between foreign currencies. The application is developed to be fast in performing the task. Following the microservice guidelines, the application is focused on executing a limited number of actions, and executing these actions in the most efficient way possible.

## Features

The application is developed in Node.js with Typescript, which ensures robustness and resilience in the event of runtime errors. Node.js is known for its speed, security and versatility. Typescript is known as a language that values good programming practice, which reduces or even eliminates code execution errors.

We can highlight the following characteristics:

* Robustness
* Resilience
* speed
* Safety
* Versatility
* Accuracy

## Installing

The application is simple to install. Below is a suggestion of steps to follow:

1) Clone the repository in a directory on your localhost or remotehost.

&ensp;> $ cd dev-projects <br>
&ensp;> $ git clone https://github.com/miguelamello/node-calculator <br>

2) Install all packages and dependencies needed to run the application.

&ensp;> $ cd node-calculator <br>
&ensp;> $ npm install <br>

3) You have to install globally the package `ts-node`. 
ts-node is needed due to Typescript to be supported by Node.js

&ensp;> $ sudo npm i ts-node -g <br> 

Obs: Under Linux, MacOS, Unix you should see the ts-node binary under `/usr/local/bin/ts-node/usr/local/bin/ts-node`. Under Windows you should look for how running Typescript applications under Node.js.
